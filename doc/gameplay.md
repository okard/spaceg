can trade with other races, can be conqueror, give the order to research new technology. But something mysterious
happens in the universe are you able to stand your destiny?

The game happens on a 2d space map. Story is important, so a lot of dialogs. Mainly controlled by mouse. All things
are handled in realtime. 

Missions can be split in two types, interactive missions for story telling, the player controls each ship in realtime
and travel through the space. The second types are missions which are not directly under the control of a player,
for a mission a fleet getting configured and send out, the success of the mission getting simulated in the background with 
a results report of the mission. Similiar system which is often used in browser games. These missions can be 
used for mining, research and raids to support the resource and research system.

## Resource System

Meta resource system, similiar to browser games resources can be used for update production facilities, 
each planet is limited, new planets can be used through diplomatics when already colonized or with special
ships.
